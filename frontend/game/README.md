## 🚀 CivicWatch — The Real-World Mission Engine

**CivicWatch** transforms civic action into a gamified, blockchain-backed, AI-powered system of real-world missions and rewards. Operators are everyday citizens who take on verified tasks using drones, AR, and mobile devices—all while earning crypto and building local resilience.

---

### 🎮 Operator Missions Lifecycle

- **📍 Report Issue**  
  Operators identify and tag civic problems (e.g., potholes, hazards, outages) via AR HUD or drone feeds.

- **🛠️ Submit Solution**  
  Community members propose fixes, reports, or actions.

- **✅ Verify & Validate**  
  Validators confirm authenticity using timestamped photos, videos, and geotags.

- **💸 Reward Distribution**  
  Smart contracts automatically reward Operators, Validators, and Contributors.

- **🔁 Replication & Scaling**  
  Operators earn replication bonuses by onboarding others.

- **📡 Real-Time Engagement**  
  Live-streamed missions with viewer donations, votes, and remote support.

- **🧠 Craig AI**  
  CivicVerse's assistant routes Operators to high-priority tasks and suggests strategic actions.
