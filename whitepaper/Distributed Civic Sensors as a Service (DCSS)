Title: Distributed Civic Sensors: Open, Modular, Citizen-Deployable Environmental Monitoring
Sections:
	•	Abstract: Citizen-deployable sensors integrated into street furniture, providing real-time, multi-domain environmental data.
	•	Problem Statement: Cities lack real-time, granular environmental data for citizen engagement and predictive analytics.
	•	Proposed Solution: Modular, solar-powered sensor network streaming data to open-source platforms with predictive AI.
	•	Technical Design: Sensor modules, edge computing, solar/kinetic power, modular street furniture integration.
	•	Deployment & Testing: Pilot neighborhoods, community-hosted nodes, incremental scaling.
	•	Use Cases: Air/water/soil monitoring, citizen science, municipal planning, disaster preparedness.
	•	Impact & Scalability: National/global network potential, AI-driven city optimization, open access for all stakeholders.
	•	Future Research & Partnerships: Collaborations with cities, schools, NGOs, environmental agencies.
